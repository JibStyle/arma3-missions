IGNITION MISSIONS

Collection of items (compositions, missions, and mpmissions) for Ignition.

Getting started:

1. Symlink compositions, missions, and mpmissions folders into your Arma 3
   profile folder so that the game recognizes them.

Folder structure:

- At the top level, folders correspond to the type of item.
- At the second level, folders correspond to the required modpack.
- At the third level, folders correspond to the individual item.

Caveats:

- Arma doesn't support subdirectories for compositions, so they cannot be
  grouped by modpack. For now, compositions are named with a 2 letter prefix
  which corresponds to a modpack.
- Some items require the arma3-jibstyle mod, which is in active development.
  To use those items, you must clone and run the mod locally. Note that there
  are often breaking changes in the mod, which means items that depend on
  older commits may cease to function. TODO: Improve dependency management.
